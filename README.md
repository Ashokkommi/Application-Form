# Application-Form
creating an application form based on  java GUI
It’s small application form contains different text fields and here I am providing validations to each text field and
here I gave three buttons, one is for reset the text fields and second button is submit button to save the filled 
application in to a text document, and final button is for to close the window while click on that button (Here it’s 
ask confirmation do you want to close the window or not.).
